# Diamond-Surface-Detection

This Project is based on the real life problem solution.

In the diamond industry, many procedures and steps are being performed to get the shiny diamond we can see in the market.

The exciting journey begins with the 

-Get the diamond rock directly from the mines.
-Process the sorting and trade it into the international market via auction in bulk.
-Diamonds are processed in various stages in the manufacturing units ( It is called 9/10 diamonds are polished in the city and area where I live, Surat, India )
-In the processing units, the majority of the diamond needs to be gone through Sarine company's high-tech machine (Israel based company, the most popular in the industry), which scans the diamond from the inside and we must mark the flat surface point manually which is a headache to do the process fast.
-I have written a Python image processing program based on the openCV image processing Python library and applied some algorithmic work to find out these types of points automatically, which are the first based on the priority depending on the curves of the surface.
-This can be applied to get optimized results and make the process fast by more than 70% in this particular phase of manufacturing.
